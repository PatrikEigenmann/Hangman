# Hangman

## About

The classic game Hangman offers a hands-on way to explore the MVC design pattern. By separating Word (Model), GUI (View), and game logic (Controller), this project helps put the concept into practice using Java Swing. I'm building it not just to play—but to learn.

## Author

Hello, my name is **Patrik Eigenmann**. I spent nine years as a software engineer working with Java and C# on server-side backend projects. Along the way, I picked up PHP, HTML, and CSS. Later I pivoted to audio—now I work full-time as a Sound Engineer and production manager for large-scale corporate and private live events.

Even now, I still write software in C and Java, especially GUI applications. It’s a passion I never dropped. Programming helps me reflect, learn, and structure my thoughts about how the world works. Most of my projects come from real-world needs.

If you find this project useful, consider donating a few bucks via [PayPal](mailto:p.eigenmann@gmx.net). I appreciate every small contribution—it encourages me to keep developing practical, usable tools that solve real problems.

Thanks for checking out my repo. I hope it helps you.
